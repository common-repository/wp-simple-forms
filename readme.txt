Adding forms to a webpage has never been easier.  Quickly create dropdowns, checkboxes, multiple choice, and text questions for any page on your site.

== Description ==

WP Simple Forms is a hybrid between the Custom Contact Forms plugin already on WordPress and Google forms. The backend interface is very similar to the interface you see on Google forms, allowing you to easily create text, multiple choice, check box questions, textareas, and drop down menus. Questions can also be marked as required.
